# DalekBot
This is the code for my Dalek Bot</p>
</p>
DalekV2Drive.py - Contains the functions required to make the motors work.</p>
DalekV2MainV2.py - Contains the main control code.  The plan is to have this be the locus of control with functions for each event in PiWars.  Additional modules will be created as deemed necessary.</p>
</p>
